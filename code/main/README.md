# Code for training and evaluating model

files:

- `TCGA_training.py`: training tile-level or attention-based model. You can set the desired level of annotation detail (dominant regions, all tumor regions, whole slide)
  - Note that in the current implementation, setting a certain level of annotation detail is achieved by selecting the dataframe with the correct filename (e.g. dataframe
which only contains tiles from dominant tumor region, as created in 
[prepare_dataframe.py](https://github.com/mpizurica/WSI_mut/blob/master/code/data_prep/tcga/prepare_dataframe.py)). 
  - Important arguments:
  
  ```
  --annot               Whether to use tiles from annotated regions. If `False`, then tiles from the whole slide image are used.
  --all-regions         only relevant if `annot` is `True`. If `all-regions` is `False`, then only tiles from the dominant tumor region will be included. Otherwise, all annotated regions are taken into account. 
  --attention           If `True`, attention-based model is used, otherwise tile-level model.
  ```
    - results (model checkpoints, logfile...) will be saved in the dir provided in `dest-folder`
